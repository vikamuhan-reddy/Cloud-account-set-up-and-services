# Azure Account Creation Guide

## Aim

- Click **“Start free”** or **“Create a free account”** in the top right corner.

### Step 2: Sign in or Create a Microsoft Account
- If you already have a Microsoft account (e.g., Outlook, Hotmail), sign in using your credentials.  
- If not, click **“Create one!”** to register a new Microsoft account.
